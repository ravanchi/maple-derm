IMAGES DIRECTORY

For a production website, you'll need the following images:

1. hero-bg.jpg - A high-quality hero image (recommended size: 1920x1080px)
2. Logo image (if not using text-based logo)
3. Service section images (3 images, one for each service)
4. Team photos for "Our Story" section
5. Any background textures or patterns

For placeholder purposes, you can:
- Use the placeholder.html file in this directory to create a simple gradient placeholder
- Use services like Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/) for royalty-free stock images
- For a dermatology site, look for clean, bright images with neutral colors

Image optimization tips:
- Compress all images before uploading to your website
- Use WebP format where possible for better performance
- Provide proper alt text for accessibility
